# Code Collective 

## A website designed to integrate fun and professionalism within the Redwood Code community.
This project was created to demonstrate understanding of technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, Angular Js, JSON, Restful API's.

### Framework
The group agreed to create a website designed to help Redwood Code Academy students. The work was divided, I was in charge of the home page and the mock forum page. Jerri Ho was in charge of the tech news page, and Kenley Lewis was in charge of the gif/meme's page.

### Challenges

- First project where we all worked as a group. Making sure each others code would not break the others when pushing or pulling to the origin master.

### Things Enjoyed

- Designing and developing the home page.
- Working as a team to complete the project and fix each others bugs.

### Things i would do differently 

- Time estimation should account for bugs and changes in design.
